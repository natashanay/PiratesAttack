# PiratesAttack
this was first try at a pirate game...want to add to later pirate adventures
in this game i used Python with Django as framework and HTML to render the information 
from the database. i used python becuase i wanted to learn more about it and that was in 
a class i was taking. i learned more about database models in this project and am still learning.
i want to add the feature of being able to "attack" to the pirate adventures project i posted.
